# Project 10: 2nd Integrated Project
 
**Objective:** To develop a prototype machine learning model for Zyfra, a company that develops efficiency solutions for heavy industry, that predicts the amount of gold recovered from ore during the extraction and purification processes so that Zyfra can optimize product efficiency and identify unprofitable parameters.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data evaluation, outlier detection and removal, data visualization, machine learning model selection, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating models using sMAPE (symmetric mean absolute percentage error)
